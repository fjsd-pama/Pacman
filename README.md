# What's new
Pacman is a casual game inspired from the original Pacman game, but with a modern touch and a different game mechanics. It is composed of 3 modesâ€”Classic, Timed, and Revenge. Below is a set of instructions to the different game modes. Are you ready to play?

# CLASSIC:
It's raining ghosts! Avoid them by moving left or right using the left and right arrow keys. At the same time, you need to feed pacman with the different pellets or else he'll die out of hunger. So what are you waiting for? Move fast, be wise and see how far you can go!

# TIMED:
Using the space bar, shoot the ghost that appears randomly on the screen. Remember not to panic. Keep safe and shoot as many ghosts as you can within the given time!

# REVENGE:
The ghosts are coming your way! Protect your base by shooting the ghosts using the space bar. You can also plant some bombs anywhere in the lawn to kill more ghosts by pressing the C button. Now, get out there and don't let a single ghost pass!
